    <h1> Leo Bitterman</h1>
    <p style="color:slateblue;"> When I'm not in school, working at Starbucks, or sleeping, I like to 
      watch movies, swim, play with my cat named Willow, or hang w my snake 
      named Tequila. I also love painting and drawing and do freelance work 
      to make some extra bread.
